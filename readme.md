# NoWag: A Unified Framework for Shape Preserving Compression of Large Language Models

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and resources for the paper **"NoWag: A Unified Framework for Shape Preserving Compression of Large Language Models"**. The framework introduces a novel approach to compress large language models while preserving their structural integrity and performance.

## Features
- **Shape-preserving compression**: Maintains the architecture of the original model.
- **Unified framework**: Supports various compression techniques.
- **Scalable**: Designed for large-scale language models.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NoWag.git
cd NoWag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training
To train a compressed model:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/compression_config.yaml
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the compressed model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/compressed_model
```
